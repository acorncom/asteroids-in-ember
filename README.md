# Asteroids-ember

Full credit for all visualization work done here goes to Mark Markoh (<a href="https://twitter.com/markmarkoh">@markmarkoh</a>).  All original code was pulled from his repo here: https://github.com/markmarkoh/asteroids.

I mainly shifted things into Ember as a quick experiment to see how easy it was to use D3 and Ember.
